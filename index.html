       1) What is Technology?
       <br><br> 
       Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or, as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment.Technology is the way we apply scientific knowledge for practical purposes. It includes machines (like computers) but also techniques and processes (like the way we produce computer chips). It might seem like all technology is only electronic, but that's just most modern technology.
<br><br>
       2) What are the use of technology in our life?
       <br><Br>
        We use technologies to exchange information, to clean our clothes, to prepare our meals and to get from one place to another. But even everyday items like door locks, floor panels and furniture are technologies that we now take for granted and that seem less impressive to us than self-driving cars or 3D printing.Technology gives us ways to eliminate repetition. ...
        It gives us the ability to create more equality in our society. ...
        We have more knowledge available to us because of technology. ...
        Technology lets us have fun in unique ways. ...
        We understand the value of money better because of technology.
<br><br>
        3)What are the disadvantages of using technology?

3) Do you know who invented this technology?
<br><br>
Thomas Edison, American inventor who, singly or jointly, held a world-record 1,093 patents. In addition, he created the world's first industrial research laboratory.
<br><br>
4) Do you know the Introduction History of technology?
<br><br>
In ancient times, technology was defined by Homer and Hesiod as the spoken word of manual craft or cunning skill (Luna, 1994).  By 330 BC, Aristotle coined the Greek term technologia and split scientific knowledge into three parts: theoretical science, practical science, and productive science (technology).
According to Luna (1994), the earliest use of the word technology in the United States was found an a Harvard University course on the "application of the Sciences to the Useful Arts" in 1816.  The 1832 Encyclopedia Americana defined technology as principles, processes, and nomenclatures. Ever since that time, there has been debate as to the definition and identity of technology.  
From a historical perspective, philosophers of technology agree that two phases of technology can be seen: the craft phase and the modern scientized phase.  However, to a philosopher of technology, modern technology, although scientized, is a unique structure of thinking, not merely applied science. Nor, is technology, like science, fully described by the laws of nature.

  A binary number system is one of the four types of number system. In computer applications, where binary numbers are represented by only two symbols or digits, i.e. 0 (zero) and 1(one). The binary numbers here are expressed in the base-2 numeral system. For example, (101)2 is a binary number.
